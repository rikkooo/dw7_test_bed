# Cycle 3 Research Report: Hardening the Project Test Suite

## 1. Research Objective

The objective of this research cycle was to identify the next highest-priority task for improving the DW7 workflow and its associated project template, following the major stabilization efforts of Cycle 2.

## 2. Findings

- The core `dw6` CLI tool and workflow are now stable and feature-complete.
- The default project template created by `dw6 setup` is functional but lacks automated quality assurance.
- A robust, automated test suite is a critical component for any serious development project to ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and facilitate continuous integration.

## 3. Recommendation

Based on these findings, the recommendation is to **harden the default project template by adding an integrated test suite.**

This will involve:

- Choosing a standard testing framework (`pytest` is recommended).
- Creating a `tests/` directory as part of the `dw6 setup` command.
- Adding a basic example test file to the template.
- Including instructions on how to run the tests in the generated `README.md`.

This improvement will ensure that all future projects initialized with the DW7 workflow have a strong foundation for quality from the very beginning.

## 4. Next Step

Proceed to the `Coder` stage to implement the recommended changes to the project template.
