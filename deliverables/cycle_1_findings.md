# DW7 Workflow - Cycle 1 Findings

This document tracks all flaws, bugs, and improvement points discovered during the initial observational cycle of the DW7 protocol.

## 1. Workflow Automation Gaps (`start-project-dw7.md`)

* **Finding:** The workflow script references a `dw6 setup` command that is not implemented in the `dw6` CLI tool.
* **Impact:** This breaks the automated setup process, requiring manual intervention for Git initialization, remote configuration, and the initial push.
* **Suggestion:** Implement the `dw6 setup` command or update the workflow documentation to reflect the manual steps required.

## 2. Missing `.gitignore` in Template

* **Finding:** The base project template does not include a `.gitignore` file.
* **Impact:** The local virtual environment (`.venv`) and other transient files are incorrectly added to the Git repository during the initial commit.
* **Suggestion:** Add a comprehensive Python `.gitignore` file to the root of the DW6 project template.

## 3. Unhandled Git Authentication

* **Finding:** The workflow does not handle modern GitHub authentication requirements (Personal Access Tokens).
* **Impact:** The `git push` command fails with a fatal authentication error when using standard HTTPS URLs.
* **Suggestion:** The setup process (ideally an automated `setup` command) should configure the Git remote to use a PAT, or the documentation should explicitly guide the user through this configuration.

## 4. Brittle Integration Test

* **Finding:** The integration test `test_approve_coder_stage_creates_deliverable` fails because it executes in a temporary directory that is not a Git repository.
* **Impact:** The test suite is not self-contained and cannot run successfully without a pre-existing Git environment, reducing its reliability.
* **Suggestion:** The test should be updated to create and use a temporary, mock Git repository to ensure it can run in isolation.

## 5. Incorrect Cycle Numbering

* **Finding:** The `dw6 new` command generated a specification file named `cycle_6_technical_specification.md` instead of `cycle_1_technical_specification.md`.
* **Impact:** The cycle tracking mechanism is not initializing correctly, leading to confusing and potentially conflicting deliverable filenames.
* **Suggestion:** Investigate the state management component of the `dw6` tool to ensure the cycle counter starts at 1 for new projects.

## 6. Prompt Augmentation Failure

* **Finding:** The `dw6 new` command's Prompt Augmentation System failed to populate the `System Context` section of the technical specification, leaving all fields as `Unknown`.
* **Impact:** A key feature of the workflow is non-functional. The AI does not receive the necessary context (current state, git status, etc.) to generate accurate and context-aware technical specifications.
* **Suggestion:** Debug the `dw6 new` command and the underlying `PromptAugmenter` to ensure it correctly gathers and injects the system context into the prompt.

## 7. Missing `status` command

* **Finding:** The `start-project-dw7.md` workflow refers to a `dw6 status` command that doesn't exist.
* **Impact:** There is no way to check the current state of the project as described in the workflow, causing confusion and breaking the documented process.
* **Suggestion:** Implement the `dw6 status` command or remove it from the workflow documentation and provide an alternative method for checking the state.
