# Cycle 2 Findings: DW7 Workflow Stabilization

## 1. Executive Summary

This cycle focused on hardening the DW7 development workflow by addressing critical bugs and implementing missing features in the `dw6` CLI tool. The primary objectives were to fix the cycle-tracking logic, add essential `setup` and `status` commands, and repair the prompt augmentation system. All objectives were successfully met, resulting in a significantly more stable, robust, and usable workflow.

## 2. Bugs Fixed

### 2.1. Incorrect Cycle-Tracking in `dw6 new`

- **Symptom:** The `dw6 new` command did not increment the `RequirementPointer`, causing all new specifications to be generated for Cycle 1 and preventing the workflow from advancing.
- **Root Cause:** The command was not updating the `logs/workflow_state.txt` file after generating a new specification.
- **Fix:** Refactored the `new` command in `src/dw6/main.py` to correctly read the current `RequirementPointer`, increment it, and save the updated state.

### 2.2. Prompt Augmentation Failure

- **Symptom:** The "System Context" section in generated technical specifications was empty.
- **Root Cause:** The `PromptAugmenter` class was designed to fetch context from a local web server (`http://127.0.0.1:8000`), but this server was not implemented or running.
- **Fix:**
  - Created a new FastAPI context server in `src/dw6/context_server.py` to provide workflow state, Git status, and project requirements via REST endpoints.
  - Added a `dw6 serve` command to `src/dw6/main.py` to easily run this server.
  - Refactored the `WorkflowManager` to accept a `project_root`, allowing the server to correctly locate the project state regardless of its running directory.

### 2.3. `dw6 setup` Initialization Logic Flaw

- **Symptom:** The `dw6 setup` command would fail in a clean directory, incorrectly reporting that the project was already initialized.
- **Root Cause:** The `WorkflowManager` was too eagerly creating the `logs/workflow_state.txt` file upon instantiation, causing the setup command's validation check to fail.
- **Fix:** Decoupled state initialization from the `WorkflowManager`'s constructor. The state file is now only created when explicitly requested by the `setup` command, after all validation checks have passed.

## 3. New Features Implemented

### 3.1. `dw6 status` Command

- A new `status` command was added to the CLI.
- **Functionality:** Displays the current `CurrentStage` and `RequirementPointer` from the workflow state file, providing essential visibility into the workflow's status.

### 3.2. `dw6 setup` Command

- A new `setup` command was added to the CLI.
- **Functionality:** Automates the initialization of a new DW7 project by:
  - Creating the standard directory structure (`deliverables`, `logs`, `docs`).
  - Generating a comprehensive `.gitignore` file.
  - Initializing the `workflow_state.txt` file to start at Cycle 1.
  - Initializing a Git repository and creating the initial commit.

### 3.3. `dw6 serve` Command

- A new `serve` command was added to the CLI.
- **Functionality:** Runs the context server required for the prompt augmentation system to function.

## 4. Conclusion

Cycle 2 has successfully transformed the DW7 workflow from a brittle prototype into a stable and functional development system. With the core bugs fixed and essential commands in place, the protocol is now ready for use in subsequent development cycles. The next step is to formally approve this "Researcher" stage and proceed with using the newly stabilized workflow for all future work.
